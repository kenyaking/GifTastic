Challenge/Problem: Create an app using the Giphy api that displays images. 

Solution: This application displays different gif images upon clicking buttons with names related to the gif. Users of the app can add a topic and the app will display gif images related to the topic. When the user clicks on a gif, the gif will play and when the user clicks again, the gif stops moving. The app uses the giphy api and gif search engine for pulling the associated images. 

Technology: Giphy, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap
